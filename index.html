                    <h2>About Sabrina</h2>
                    <h3>Founder of Itzy Bitzy Speech Therapy</h3>
                    <p>Hi! I'm Sabrina Itzhaki — a licensed speech-language pathologist, the heart behind Itzy Bitzy Speech Therapy, and someone who fully believes that learning should feel like fun, not work.</p>
                    <p>Over the past 5 years, I've worked with hundreds of children across NYC public schools — helping kids speak more clearly, express their ideas, and feel proud of their voices. I specialize in treating speech sound disorders, but I also support children with language delays and early literacy skills — all through personalized, playful, and meaningful sessions.</p>
                    
                    <h4>I'm not your typical therapist.</h4>
                    <p>I believe the best speech sessions are the ones where your child is fully engaged — not because they have to be, but because they want to be. That's why I take a child-led, interest-driven approach: if your child loves superheroes, we're saving the world while practicing sounds. Into baking? We're becoming master play chefs while whipping up some sweet new vocabulary. Let's build speech goals into the things they already love. That's when the magic happens.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whether your child needs help saying their sounds more clearly or organizing their thoughts into full sentences, I meet them right where they are — and we grow from there, together.</p>

                <p>You'll probably find me wandering through Brooklyn with a croissant in hand, on the hunt for the best bakeries and farmer's markets. I love spending time with my husband and our labradoodle, Melo (we're regulars at the dog park!), and I'm on a mission to visit every U.S. National Park — I've made it to 23 so far!</p>

                        <li><strong>Literacy & Early Reading Skills</strong> - If your child is having trouble with phonemic awareness, decoding, or comprehension, I use research-backed strategies to strengthen the connection between speech and reading.</li>
